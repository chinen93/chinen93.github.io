Programs to simulate a sequence of keyboard inputs in a specific setting. Those inputs were necessary to update an inventory database using a program that didn't support macros. So I create the following programs to be able to read from a file and input simulate keyboard presses. Automating some steps.

Simulation created:
- Macro Simulation
- Register Simulation
- Location Simulation
