I spent a year conducting Artificial Intelligence research, where I developed a Reinforcement Learning algorithm for trading Brazilian stocks. My key responsibility was to research, design the environment and train the AI models. In my day to day, I coded in Python (PyTorch), ran experiments, analyzed large datasets, and ensured our AI systems were scalable, accurate, and compliant with legal standards.

- Conducted research and development of a reinforcement learning-based artificial intelligence designed to operate on the Brazilian stock market. Focused on maximizing daily profits by trading Bovespa mini-index contracts (WIN). Algorithm used Agent-Critic (AC), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)
