I worked as a Software Developer for a year, focusing on building an automated tool that retrieved public documents to maintain compliance in transactions. This data was then displayed on a web dashboard. My daily tasks included coding in Python (Django) and JavaScript (React.js), conducting code reviews, and ensuring the project adhered to functional, non-functional, and design requirements.

- Assisted in an automated system for searching and analyzing unstructured documents and images.

- Developed automatic search tools for public certificates to ensure compliance, presenting the retrieved information in a comprehensive dashboard.
