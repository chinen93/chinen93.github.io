As a Software Developer working remotely with international teams (Brazil, Canada, India), I focused on enhancing Ericsson's Digital Monetization Platform. My key responsibility was to implement new features and fix issues in microservices for product offering transactions. A significant portion of my work was spent on proof-of-concept projects, where I explored innovative ways to adapt Ericsson’s software solutions for new use cases. Daily, I worked with Camunda to handle system flows, modeled entities, developed Java and JavaScript code, mentored junior developers, and produced documentation. This role required expertise in microservice architecture, Kubernetes, process automation, and system integration to deliver scalable and functional solutions aligned with Ericsson’s goals.
