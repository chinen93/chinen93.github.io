      <description>&lt;p&gt;&#xA;I started using Emacs in 2015 during my first year of university, likely with version 25.1. It&amp;#39;s hard to believe that it&amp;#39;s been nearly a decade since I began my journey with this powerful tool. Over the years, Iâ€™ve experienced a couple of &amp;#34;dot-emacs bankruptcies,&amp;#34; where my configurations became too cumbersome and inefficient. But this time, things are different.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#xA;In my early attempts, I experimented with all sorts of configurations, adding every new Elisp functions and macros inside my Emacs just trying new stuff and failing to make all work together. However, the result was chaos - startup times creeping up to two minutes and barely anything working.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
